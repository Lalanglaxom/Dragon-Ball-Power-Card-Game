# Rules

Who goes first is determined by random EACH ROUND


- 1st Round:
	- STANDOFF PHASE:
	  	- P1 Turn
			- Put down 3 cards face down, at least 1 battle card 
		- P2 Turn
	   		- Do the same as P1
        - BATTLE PHASE:
		- P1 Turn
	   		- Flip at least 1 battle card
		- P2 Turn
			- Flip cards until total power is bigger the total power of P1's cards
	  	- P1 Turn
			- Flip cards until total power is bigger the total power of P2's cards
   	  
	Turn ends when 1 player cannot flip anymore card, the player with higher total power wins the round
	Player who lost move all their cards to the grave
	Let's say it's P1 who wins

- 2nd Round:
	- STANDOFF PHASE:
	  	- P2 Turn
	  	  	- 2 Choices: - Put down cards so that total power higher than P1's
	  	  		     - Put down the same number of cards as P1's face UP cards
	  	- P1 Turn
	  	  	- If there's face down cards on field, P1 can replace it with other battle or faux cards
   	- BATTLE PHASE:
   	  	- Repeat
